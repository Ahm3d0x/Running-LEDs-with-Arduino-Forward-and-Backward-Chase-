# Running LEDs with Arduino (Forward and Backward Chase)

A simple Arduino project that uses 9 LEDs connected to digital pins 2 through 10 to create a forward and backward LED chasing effect.  
Perfect for beginners to learn digital output control, loops, and basic circuit building with Arduino.

## Circuit Connections

Each LED anode (long leg) is connected to Arduino digital pins D2 through D10.  
Each LED cathode (short leg) is connected to GND through a 220Ω resistor.

| Arduino Pin | LED Number |
|-------------|-------------|
| D2          | LED 1       |
| D3          | LED 2       |
| D4          | LED 3       |
| D5          | LED 4       |
| D6          | LED 5       |
| D7          | LED 6       |
| D8          | LED 7       |
| D9          | LED 8       |
| D10         | LED 9       |

# How to Use
## Build the circuit on a breadboard as described above.

- Open the Arduino IDE.

- Connect your Arduino Uno using a USB cable.

- paste the code into a new sketch in Arduino IDE.

- Select the correct board under Tools > Board > Arduino Uno.

- Select the correct port under Tools > Port.

- Click Upload.

- Watch the LEDs light up in a chasing pattern—forward then backward.
